Subject: [PATCH] HACK: ntdll: Run WT_EXECUTEINWAITTHREAD wait callbacks
 serially.

On Windows, waits registered with the WT_EXECUTEINWAITTHREAD flag will
often have their callbacks run serially (since they're all handled by
the same wait thread). Running them in parallel can expose race
conditions.
Use a process-wide critical section to serialize these callbacks.
