# wine-tkg-git and proton-tkg patches

**More userpatches for wine-tkg are also made available by @openglfreak : https://github.com/openglfreak/wine-tkg-userpatches**

*Thank you!*

### Wine/Proton-tkg-git will auto-clone this repo two dirs up from their buildscript dir (`../../community-patches`) if valid community patches are found in their .cfg file (`_community_patches=""` array).
### Alternatively, you can also clone this repo by hand next to the `wine-tkg-git` root dir (the one containing both `wine-tkg-git` and `proton-tkg` dirs) so the build system sees it - `git clone https://github.com/Frogging-Family/community-patches.git`.
